<h1>About Page</h1>
<p>This Ruby on Rails project was developed as part of my third semester at Red River Polytechnic. For this project, I utilized the Faker gem to generate fake data and populate the database with realistic information.

The dataset consists of two main tables: "matches" and "goals". The "matches" table represents soccer matches and contains columns such as id, date, home_team, away_team, stadium, created_at, updated_at, and an optional api_id. On the other hand, the "goals" table stores information about the goals scored in those matches, including the id, match_id (foreign key referencing the matches table), player_name, minute, created_at, and updated_at.

The relationship between these tables is a one-to-many association. This means that a single match can have multiple goals associated with it. The foreign key "match_id" in the goals table establishes the connection between a goal and its corresponding match. By querying the goals table and filtering by the match_id, you can retrieve the goals associated with a specific match. Conversely, you can access the match associated with a goal by utilizing the match association defined in the Goal model.

This association enables you to effectively retrieve and manipulate data based on the relationship between matches and goals. Whether you want to view the goals scored in a particular match or retrieve the match information for a specific goal, the one-to-many relationship between the matches and goals tables allows for efficient data retrieval and analysis.</p>
